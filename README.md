# 🚀 Streamlit Mastery: Build C00L Data Science Apps

Welcome to the ultimate guide for creating **interactive, high-quality data science applications** using **Streamlit**, the Python library that transforms scripts into web apps in minutes.

This repository is designed to help developers, data enthusiasts, and beginners alike to:

- ✅ Learn Streamlit from scratch
- ✅ Build interactive dashboards and apps
- ✅ Integrate data visualizations, charts, and media
- ✅ Deploy apps effortlessly to share with the world

### 📚 What You'll Learn

- **Setting up Streamlit** on your system
- **Creating dynamic apps** with widgets, buttons, and inputs
- **Visualizing data** with popular Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn
- **Handling media**: images, videos, and audio
- **Deployment tips** for sharing your apps online
- ...and much more!

### 🌟 To Be Added S00N:

- **Authentication**
- **Configuration**
- **App Testing**

### ⚠️ Note

- The commands and instructions in this guide are based on **Windows Terminal**. Users on **macOS** or **Linux** may need to adjust commands accordingly.

- And also, the cells will not run and throw errors such as:
  `Thread 'MainThread': missing ScriptRunContext! This warning can be ignored when running in bare mode.`
  According to my research on this error, this occurs when you do not run a Streamlit Python code using `streamlit run your_app.py` in the terminal. Bare mode means when you are directly running the script rather than using the Normal mode where you run it using Streamlit's CLI utility. So, if you have to use any certain code of a cell, kindly create a new file and use `streamlit run` to open a development server and run your code.
